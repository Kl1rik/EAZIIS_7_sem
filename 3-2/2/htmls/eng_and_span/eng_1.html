            <p>When i worked as a copywriter at a dog-toy-slash-tech company,
            we used Airtable and Basecamp to organize our workflows. At my
            next job, the marketers made us learn Asana (“same as Airtable but
            much better”), but the product team pushed their work and sprints
            through Jira. I was laid off before I had to learn Jira, and at my next
            gig they swore by Airtable, which, phew, I already knew. But
            efficiencies were still being lost, apparently, and Airtable took the
            blame. As I was leaving that job, I heard someone mention that a new
            program, Trello, was going to replace Airtable and “change
            everything” for us. I came back as a contractor a few years later, and
            everything had not changed. The company had moved on from Trello
            and was now in the thrall of something called Monday.com. It, too,
            promised big changes.

            <p>If you work as an “individual contributor”—engineer, copywriter,
            designer, data analyst, marketer—in the modern white-collar
            workforce, you’ve probably encountered one of these
            project-management software (PM software) enterprises. Your
            onboarding will include an invitation to collaborate from the likes of
            Smartsheet, Notion, Udemy, ClickUp, Projectworks, Wrike, and
            Height. The list seems endless and yet is somehow still growing. More
            than a hundred proprietary apps and planners are currently vying for
            companies’ business, all promising increased productivity, seamless
            workflow, and unmatched agility. And if, like me, you’ve ping-ponged
            between a couple of jobs and project teams over a few years, you’ve
            had to come to terms with the fact that misunderstandings and
            confusion are natural in any large workforce. But in an increasingly
            digital, increasingly remote age of work, you might still imagine that a
            “killer app” really would win. And yet none of these PM software
            services make work work. The key to these deficiencies lies in the
            history of workplace efficiency itself—starting with the original
            business consultants.
            </p>
            <p>Before the second Industrial Revolution, there was practically no such
            thing as productivity. (The word itself basically didn’t exist before
            1900.) As factories became more complex and wage-laborers
            proliferated, the goal of capital became ensuring the efficiency of its
            labor. If connecting your workplace annoyance with too many Trello
            notifications to the plight of a machinist building lathes in the 1900s
            gives you vertigo, you aren’t alone. But the idea of making sure you’re
            working efficiently is as old as the idea of being employed.
            </p>
            <p>And so the 1900s ushered in what we know as project management.
            According to Frederic Taylor’s The Principles of Scientific
            Management, the goal of managing workers “should be to secure the
            maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum
            prosperity for each employee.” At the same time that Taylor, a
            mechanical engineer, rose from the factory floor to become one of
            America’s first workplace narcs (or consultants), another engineer,
            Henry Gantt, popularized and codified the basics of the Gantt chart, a
            simple bar chart that turns a project’s schedule into a set of lines on
            an x- and y-axis, with time moving from left to right. Also called the
            “waterfall” method, Gantt charts create a visual metaphor of tasks and
            their dependencies and contingencies so you can see each individual
            task in terms of when it should start and when it must be completed,
            relative to the overall project and the tasks coming before it.</p>
            <p>Are you a graphic designer waiting for photos and copy to come in
            before you can design a banner ad? In many of our modern PM
            software apps, you can see those prerequisites, as on modern Gantt
            charts offered by Monday.com, Wrike, Microsoft Project, and Click Up.
            Asana also has Gantt templates</p>
