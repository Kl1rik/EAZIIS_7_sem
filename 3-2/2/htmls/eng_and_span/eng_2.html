    <title>What do neurons, fireflies and dancing the Nutbush have in common?</title>
</head>
<body>
     <p>Synchronised phenomena are all around us, whether it is human
     clapping and dancing, or the way fireflies flash, or how our neurons and
     heart cells interact. However, it is something not fully understood in
     engineering and science.</p>
     <p>Associate Professor Joseph Lizier, expert in complex systems at the
     University of Sydney, said: "We know the feeling of dancing in step to the
     'Nutbush' in a crowd -- or the awkward feeling when people lose time
     clapping to music. Similar processes occur in nature, and it is vital that
     we better understand how falling in and out of sync actually works.
     </p>
     <p>"Being in sync in a system can be very good; you want your heart cells
     to all beat together rather than fibrillate. But being in sync can also be
     very bad; you don't want your brain cells to all fire together in an epileptic
     seizure."</p>
     <p>The paper sets out the mathematics of how the network structure
     connecting a set of individual elements controls how well they can
     synchronise their activity. It is a critical insight into how these systems
     operate, because in most real-world systems, no one individual element
     controls all the others. And nor can any individual directly see and react
     to all the others: they are only connected through a network.</p>
     <p>Associate Professor Lizier, from the Centre of Complex Systems and the
     School of Computer Science in the Faculty of Engineering, said: "Our
     results open new opportunities for designing network structures or
     interventions in networks. This could be super useful in stabilising
     electricity in power grids, vital for the transition to renewables, or to avoid
     neural synchronisation in the brain, which can trigger epilepsy."
     </p>
     <p>To understand how these systems work, the researchers studied what
     are known as "walks" through a network in a complex system. Walks are
     sequences of connected hops between individual elements or nodes in
     the network.
     </p>
     <p>Associate Professor Lizier said: "Our maths examines paired walks:
     where you start at one node and set off on two walks with randomly
     chosen hops between nodes for a specified number of steps. Those two
     walks might end up at the same node (convergent walks) or at different
     nodes (divergent walks).
     </p>
     <p>"Our main finding is that the more commonly paired walks on a network
     are convergent, the worse the quality of synchronisation on that network
     structure would be."
     This is good news for the brain, where synchronisation is not desirable
     as it can cause epilepsy . The brain's highly modular structure means it
     has a high proportion of convergent walks, which naturally push it away
     from epilepsy.</p>
     <p>"We can even draw an analogy to social media with the echochamber
     phenomenon," said co-author Jurgen Jost, whose group also works on
     social network dynamics. "Here we see sub-groups reinforcing their own
     messages, via convergent walks within their own group, but not
     necessarily synchronising to the wider population."
     The findings represent a major step forward in the theory of how the
     structure of complex networks affects their dynamics or how they
     compute, such as how brain structure underpins cognition.</p>
