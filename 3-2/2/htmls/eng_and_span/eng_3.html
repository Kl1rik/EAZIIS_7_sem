  <p>The second-generation Nissan Juke might be one of the Japanese
  manufacturer’s oldest offerings having arrived on the scene in 2019, but
  its design remains eye-catching and with keen leasing deals it’s more
  appealing than ever.
  </p>
  <p>We found this offer on leasing.com, allowing you to get behind the wheel
  of a well-specced Juke Acenta model from just £202 per month, with a
  sensible initial payment of £2,117.</p>
  <p>The deal runs across three years and has a mileage limit of 5,000 miles
  per year, although bump this up to a more realistic 8,000 miles and your
  monthly premium only increases to £215. Extending the deal an extra
  year on top of this means instalment payments rise to £219.</p>
  <p>As this is a PCH (Private Contract Hire) agreement there’s no option to
  buy the car at the end of the contract, so you’ll need to keep your next
  deposit in mind, because there’s no opportunity to use any equity
  remaining in the Juke when it’s time to give it back.
  </p>
  <p>The straightforward nature of a PCH plan does reduce cost for the
  customer however. If you wanted the same Juke from Nissan itself and
  on a similar agreement, you’d be looking at around £285 per month.
  </p>
  <p>The Juke is a small SUV but it has a big presence on the road. The
  chunky round fog lights and ultra thin main lights draw attention, and
  it’s a well-proportioned little car with a bulky stance. Acenta trim brings
  plenty of kit with Apple CarPlay and Android auto compatibility, an
  eight-inch central screen, 17-inch wheels and a rear-view camera.
